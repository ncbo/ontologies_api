# Workflow for deploying ontologies_api to stage/prod systems via capistrano.
# This workflow runs after a successeful execution of the unit test workflow and it
# can also be triggered manually.
#
# Required github secrets:
#
# CONFIG_REPO - github repo containing config and customizations for the API. Format 'author/private_config_repo'
# it is used for getting capistrano deployment configuration for stages on the github actions runner and
# PRIVATE_CONFIG_REPO env var is constructed from it which is used by capistrano on the remote servers for pulling configs.
#
# GH_PAT - github Personal Access Token for accessing PRIVATE_CONFIG_REPO
#
# SSH_JUMPHOST - ssh jump/proxy host though which deployments have to though if app servers are hosted on private network.
#
# DEPLOY_ENC_KEY - key for decrypting deploymnet ssh key residing in config/deploy_id_rsa_enc (see miloserdow/capistrano-deploy)
# this SSH key is used for accessing jump host, UI nodes, and private github repo.
